BonnyCI is a continuous integration (CI) service for Open Source projects.

Inspired by the success of [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org)'s
development infrastructure, we are committed to bringing the benefits
of [Zuul](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/zuul/) to many more open source projects.

OpenStack is one of the largest open source projects in the world. One of
the hallmarks of OpenStack is it's strong development infrastructure,
which has enabled quality to remain high along side velocity and
inclusiveness. A large part of that is built upon the capabilities in
the highly scalable development infrastructure OpenStack has organically
grown over ther years.

With BonnyCI, we're imagining a world where any project can tap into
these capabilities and begin making use of massively parallelized,
automated gating CI that includes cross-repository dependencies.

We strive to do everything in the open, and we invite you to join us. Our
code is available on GitHub:
