BonnyCI is a continuous integration (CI) service for Open Source projects.

Inspired by the success of OpenStack's development infrastructure,
we are committed to bringing the benefits of Zuul to many more open
source projects.

We strive to do everything in the open, and we invite you to join us. Our
code is available on GitHub:
