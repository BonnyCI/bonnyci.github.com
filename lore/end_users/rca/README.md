## RCA Process

When outages of the BonnyCI service are encountered, in the aftermath the team
will conduct a Root Cause Analysis.  This process will identify exactly what
went wrong, and what corrective steps should be taken to prevent future
outages.  Each outage will have a corresponding RCA report which will be listed
here, and each report should contain the following:

* Introduction: A brief description of the outage and links to the projman
  issue created for it.
* Event Description: A clear and concise description of the problem, stating
  date, time, detailed description of the event/problem, who detected it, who
  it affected, and how they were affected.
* Chronology of Events/Timeline: a detailed chronology of the events leading up
  to, and following, the problem.
* Investigative Team and Method: who investigated, what data was gathered, and
  what methodologies were employed to conduct the RCA
* Findings and Root Cause
* Corrective Action: what should be done to ensure the event is not repeated.
