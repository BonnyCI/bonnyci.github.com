# Project Management

## Unplanned Work

Create a new issue and label it as "Unplanned Work". If you are going to work on it then assign it to yourself and move to In Progress. If you are not going to work on it, then put it at the top of TODO. In either case bring it to the team's attention, preferably via IRC. Finally be sure to paste into comments any IRC or email conversations as you debug and discover (or don't discover) root cause.
